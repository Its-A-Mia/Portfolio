        I'm a front-end web developer based in Minnesota, and my mission is to help make the internet a more beautiful
        and accessible experience for everyone. I'm a lover of clean code, eye-catching designs, and seamless user
        experiences.

      <p>
        My journey as a developer began with a couple computer science courses and a healthy dose of trial and error;
        but once I started learning about web development, I was hooked. I'm skilled in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and
        have worked with a variety of front-end frameworks like Next.js and Material UI.

        When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you'll find me burning off some steam on the tennis court, climbing the
        ranked ladders of Rocket League, or trying out the latest local hotspots. If you have any questions or are
        interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to reach out - I'm always up for a chat!
